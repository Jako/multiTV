# Donate

multiTV is totally free and comes with no warranty or support. I give basic support on github tracker and like to receive suggestions for enhancements there.

I work on new features and bug fixes in my spare time (and if one of my clients needs a special feature). So maybe a bugfix or an answer could take some time and unfortunately some enhancement wishes won't get addressed.

If multiTV is useful for you, Iâ€™d like to hear about that as well. Donations for multiTV are appreciated. Please feel free to donate any amount that that you like to give for your multiTV usage.

multiTV is free because I have fun working on it and because I don't have the resources to properly support it. If you decide to make a donation, I thank you very much. But please remember that I'm not able to extend my support for multiTV beyond the level I have done in the past.

If you urgently need an addition to multiTV code, you could hire me for that work for sure. My email address could be found on my [github page](https://github.com/Jako).
